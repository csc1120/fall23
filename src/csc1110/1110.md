# Object Oriented Design / Object Oriented Programming
- [x] Define the following object oriented concepts:
- [x] Object types (Classes)
- [x] Class instances (Objects)
- [x] Instance variables (Attributes/Fields)
- [x] Instance behaviors/actions (Methods)
- [x] Define the concept of a driver class
- [x] Distinguish between classes and objects
- [x] Describe how objects interact with one another by sending messages

# Week 6

## UML
- [x] Correctly annotate and interpret fields (name and type) on a class diagram
- [x] Correctly annotate and interpret methods (with arguments and return type) on a class diagram
- [x] Generating class diagram from a verbal description of a class
- [x] Use visibility modifiers to denote the visibility of a field or method
 
## Class creation basics
- [ ] Describe how an object differs from a primitive
- [ ] Describe how a class differs from a primitive type
- [ ] Define and use classes with multiple methods and data members (fields)
- [ ] Define and use value-returning and void methods
- [ ] Properly use visibility modifiers in defining methods and fields
- [ ] Define and use class constants
- [ ] Understand and apply accessor and mutator methods
- [ ] Distinguish between instance variables and local variables
- [ ] Define and use instance methods and instance variables (attributes/fields)
- [ ] Define and use methods that have primitive data types as arguments
- [ ] Understand the importance of information hiding and encapsulation
- [ ] Declare and use local variables
- [ ] Describe the role of the reserved word this
- [ ] Demonstrate use of this to disambiguate object fields from local variables
- [ ] Trace a program including calls to class methods in multiple classes
- [ ] Use the debugger to trace the execution of a multi-class program
- [ ] Create and use constructor methods
 
# Week 7

- [ ] Defining your own classes
- [ ] Define and use methods that have reference data types as arguments
- [ ] Define and use overloaded methods
- [ ] Call methods of the same class
- [ ] Draw and explain memory diagrams that illustrate the instantiation of objects
- [ ] Describe the role of the garbage collector
- [ ] Compare the equality of two different objects
- [ ] Swap the data in two different objects
- [ ] Avoid redundant code by calling one constructor from a different constructor
- [ ] Understand the implications of acting on an object to which there are multiple references
